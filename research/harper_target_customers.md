**Research Date:** 2026-02-14
**Purpose:** Inform training game design with real-world accuracy about Harper's target users and the commercial insurance brokerage workflow.

---

## 1. Harper Insurance Overview

Harper (YC W25) is the first AI-native commercial insurance brokerage, founded in 2024 by **Tushar Nair** (ML/AI engineering lead at Goldman Sachs, ~9 years) and **Dakotah Rice** (Goldman Investment Banking; family background in insurance). They previously co-founded Poolit, a fintech that scaled to $100M AUM.

**What Harper is:** An E&S (Excess & Surplus) insurance brokerage that uses AI to automate the operational workflow -- submission prep, quote comparison, carrier matching, and service tasks -- so brokers can focus on client relationships.

**What Harper is NOT:** Harper is not selling software to other brokerages. Harper IS the brokerage. Their AI replaces the back-office labor that traditional brokerages require, making Harper the broker that businesses work with directly.

**Key product -- Harper Hub:**
- Aggregates data across phone calls, emails, and broker-AI agent conversations
- Reduces application time by more than 50%
- Automates submission prep, quote comparison, and service tasks (which consume over 40% of a traditional broker's time)
- Instant carrier matching and real-time decisioning
- Cuts weeks from traditional placement timelines

**Traction (as of early 2025):**
- First customer signed October 2024
- $1.1M ARR within 5 months
- $6M+ in annualized premiums written across 35 states
- 100+ new customers per week
- 98%+ retention
- Revenue per work hour grew from $6 to $71 in first 5 months
- 85% success rate for companies traditional brokers deem "uninsurable"
- 100% placement success for tech E&O policies without AI exclusions
- 25 employees

## 2. Who Are Commercial Insurance Account Executives / Producers / Brokers?

### Role Definitions

These titles overlap significantly. The distinctions:

| Title | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Producer** | Revenue-generating role; finds and wins new business. The "rainmaker." |
| **Account Executive (AE)** | Manages existing client relationships AND may produce new business. Often the primary client-facing person. |
| **Broker** | Works independently or for a brokerage; represents the CLIENT (not the carrier). Shops multiple carriers for best coverage/price. |
| **Agent** | Represents one or more CARRIERS. Can be "captive" (one carrier only) or "independent" (multiple carriers). |

In commercial lines, "broker" and "independent agent" are often used interchangeably. Harper operates as a broker -- representing the client's interests across multiple carriers.

### Demographics

- **Average age of insurance agents:** ~60 years old (the industry has a well-documented aging crisis)
- **Median age of the overall insurance workforce:** 44-45 years
- **25% of employees are over 55**
- The workforce is 52.9% women, 47.1% men
- 71.9% White, 10.6% Black, 8.9% multiracial
- Expected 6.1% growth over the next decade (faster than national average)
- Independent agents manage ~80% of all commercial insurance policies in the US

### Day-to-Day Activities

A commercial insurance AE/producer's day breaks down into these activity categories:

**Morning / Start of Day:**
- Review emails and voicemails (carrier responses, client requests, underwriter questions)
- Check renewal pipeline -- which policies expire in the next 90-120 days?
- Update CRM / agency management system (AMS) with notes from previous day
- Prioritize: who needs a callback, what submissions are pending, what quotes came in overnight

**Client-Facing Work:**
- Client meetings (in-person, Zoom, phone) to discuss coverage needs
- Risk assessment conversations -- understanding the client's operations, exposures, and changes
- Presenting proposals and explaining coverage options
- Renewal review meetings (begin 90-120 days before expiration)
- Prospecting calls and referral follow-ups for new business

**Operational / Back-Office Work:**
- Filling out ACORD forms (standardized insurance applications -- ACORD 125, 126, 130, 140)
- Gathering supporting documents: loss runs, financial statements, employee counts, revenue data
- Preparing and submitting applications to carriers/underwriters
- Re-keying data between systems (a major pain point)
- Following up with underwriters on pending submissions
- Comparing quotes across multiple carriers
- Processing endorsements (mid-term policy changes)
- Handling certificate of insurance (COI) requests
- Claims coordination and documentation

**Administrative:**
- Logging activities and updating CRM
- Compliance documentation
- Continuing education requirements
- Internal team coordination (with account managers, claims specialists)

### Key Skill Set

- Relationship building and trust development
- Risk assessment and coverage analysis
- Negotiation (with both clients and underwriters)
- Attention to detail (application accuracy directly affects quoting)
- Regulatory knowledge (licensing requirements vary by state, especially for E&S/surplus lines)
- Multi-tasking across many accounts simultaneously

## 3. What Size Agencies Does Harper Target?

### Important Clarification: Harper IS the Agency

Harper does not sell software to other agencies. Harper is itself the brokerage. Its "customers" are **businesses that need commercial insurance**, not other brokers.

### Harper's Target Customers (the Insured Businesses)

- **Mid-sized businesses with complex insurance needs**
- Industries: aerospace, defense, industrial manufacturing, tech companies, trucking, construction, consulting, and other high-risk sectors
- Companies that struggle to get coverage through traditional brokers
- Businesses with non-standard risks that require E&S (Excess & Surplus) carriers

### The E&S Market Context

Harper specifically operates in the E&S market, which is critical context:

- E&S covers risks that standard/admitted carriers **decline** to insure
- Before accessing E&S, brokers must legally prove "diligent effort" to find admitted coverage (typically 3 formal declinations)
- Wholesale brokers place 93-94% of E&S premiums
- The E&S market is characterized by long quote-to-bind cycles, high error rates, and compliance complexity
- This is an **$85 billion market** that has seen little operational innovation

### Why E&S is Perfect for AI Disruption

The E&S workflow is particularly painful because:
1. Each submission is essentially custom -- no standardized rating
2. Extensive documentation requirements
3. Multiple carrier submissions needed (since risks are non-standard)
4. Complex compliance requirements vary by state
5. Long turnaround times (weeks, not minutes)
6. Heavy reliance on human judgment and relationships

### The Broader Agency Landscape (Context)

- Independent agencies wrote **87.2%** of all commercial lines premiums
- The proportion of "small" agencies (10 or fewer employees) dropped from 75% in 2019 to under 50% in 2024
- Consolidation via M&A is reshaping the landscape -- small family-run agencies are being absorbed
- Only 51.6% of agencies had revenue under $500K (down significantly)
- One-third of agencies anticipate ownership changes within 5 years

## 4. Typical User Profile

### The Traditional Broker Harper Competes With

| Attribute | Typical Profile |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Age** | 45-65 years old |
| **Experience** | 15-30+ years in insurance |
| **Tech savviness** | Low to moderate; comfortable with email and basic systems, resistant to new tools |
| **Primary tools** | Agency Management System (Applied Epic, Vertafore AMS360), email, phone, spreadsheets, PDF ACORD forms |
| **Key frustration** | Spends more time on paperwork than on clients |
| **Revenue model** | Commission-based (10-25% of premium for commercial lines) |
| **Book of business** | $500K - $5M+ in annual premiums managed |

### Tech Adoption Divide

- **84.2%** of brokerages over $100M revenue have invested in generative AI
- Only **60%** of firms in the $25-100M range have done so
- **35%** of brokers cite lack of digital skills as a barrier to transformation
- Many brokers worry AI could diminish their role
- Manual data entry remains one of the biggest pain points

### The Person Harper Replaces (or Augments)

Harper's AI effectively replaces the **back-office and operational staff** that a traditional brokerage employs -- the people doing data entry, form filling, submission preparation, quote comparison, and follow-up. The "producers" (relationship-builders) are still human at Harper, but they are dramatically more productive because AI handles the operational load.

## 5. Commercial Insurance Sales Workflow: End-to-End

### Phase 1: Prospecting & Lead Generation (Ongoing)

- Producer identifies potential clients through referrals, networking, cold outreach
- Qualify the prospect: right industry, right size, right risk profile
- Initial discovery conversation: understand the business, its risks, current coverage
- **Time investment:** Varies wildly -- days to months of relationship building

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment & Data Gathering (1-2 weeks)

- Deep-dive into the prospect's operations, exposures, and risk profile
- Collect required information:
  - Business financials (revenue, payroll, assets)
  - Employee headcount and roles
  - Loss history / claims history (3-5 years of "loss runs")
  - Property details, vehicle schedules, equipment lists
  - Contracts and certificates of insurance
  - Industry-specific data (e.g., for construction: project types, subcontractor usage)
- This is often the most frustrating phase -- clients are slow to provide documents

### Phase 3: Application & Submission Prep (3-7 days)

- Complete ACORD forms (standardized applications):
  - **ACORD 125**: Commercial Insurance Application (the universal starting point)
  - **ACORD 126**: Commercial General Liability section
  - **ACORD 130**: Workers' Compensation application
  - **ACORD 140**: Commercial Property section
  - Plus industry-specific supplemental applications
- Prepare the "submission package": ACORD forms + loss runs + financials + narrative
- Write a "risk narrative" -- a compelling story about why this is a good risk
- **This is where Harper's AI creates massive efficiency** -- automating form completion and data aggregation

### Phase 4: Marketing to Carriers (1-3 weeks)

- Submit the package to multiple carriers/underwriters
- For standard risks: might use 3-5 carriers
- For E&S risks: might submit to 10-20+ markets
- Each carrier has different appetite, forms, and portals
- **Underwriters receive 40-60 submissions daily** -- incomplete or sloppy submissions get declined immediately
- Follow up with underwriters on pending quotes
- Answer additional questions from underwriters ("subjectivities")
- **This is the bottleneck** -- waiting for carriers is the #1 time sink

### Phase 5: Quote Comparison & Proposal (2-5 days)

- Receive quotes from carriers (different terms, premiums, exclusions, conditions)
- Build a comparison spreadsheet or proposal document
- Analyze coverage differences (not just price -- terms matter enormously)
- Prepare a client-ready proposal with recommendations
- **Harper automates this comparison** with real-time decisioning

### Phase 6: Presentation & Negotiation (1-2 weeks)

- Present options to the client
- Explain coverage differences, trade-offs, and recommendations
- Client may request changes, negotiate terms, or need internal approvals
- May need to go back to carriers for revised quotes
- This is pure relationship and advisory work -- the part producers love

### Phase 7: Binding (1-3 days)

- Client selects a carrier/option
- Broker sends "bind request" to the carrier
- Carrier issues a binder (temporary proof of coverage)
- Process premium payment
- Finalize paperwork and issue policy documents

### Phase 8: Ongoing Service (continuous)

- Issue certificates of insurance (COIs) as needed (landlords, contracts, etc.)
- Process endorsements (coverage changes mid-term)
- Handle claims support
- Annual stewardship meetings
- **Begin renewal process 90-120 days before expiration** -- the cycle restarts

### Total Timeline: Prospect to Bound Policy

- **Best case (standard risk, existing relationship):** 2-4 weeks
- **Typical commercial placement:** 4-8 weeks
- **Complex E&S placement:** 6-16+ weeks
- **Renewal (existing client):** 2-6 weeks (starting 90-120 days before expiration)

## 6. Time Split: Admin/Paperwork vs. Selling/Relationships

### Industry Data

| Activity | % of Time | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Administrative/paperwork tasks | **50-57%** | Vertafore industry survey: 57% of insurance professionals spend more than half their day on admin |
| Selling, prospecting, client relationships | **30-40%** | Estimated from inverse of admin time |
| Education, compliance, internal meetings | **10-15%** | Industry estimates |

### What "Administrative" Includes

- Filling out ACORD forms and applications
- Re-keying data between carrier portals, AMS, and CRM
- Chasing documents from clients (loss runs, financials, etc.)
- Following up with underwriters on submissions
- Processing endorsements and COI requests
- Logging activities and updating systems
- Compliance documentation
- Quote comparison spreadsheets

### The Core Problem Harper Solves

The traditional ratio is roughly **60/40 admin to selling**. Harper's thesis is that AI can flip this ratio -- automating the 40%+ of broker time spent on manual, back-office tasks so that the human effort is concentrated on relationship building and advisory work. Their revenue-per-work-hour metric ($6 to $71 in 5 months) demonstrates this leverage in practice.

### Key Stats on the Admin Burden

- A single policy that once required 1-2 touchpoints now requires 3-4+ due to increasing complexity
- Commission structures have NOT increased to reflect this added work
- Underwriters receive 40-60 submissions daily and immediately reject incomplete ones
- 33% of sales tasks can be automated (McKinsey)
- Automating quoting alone can increase productivity by up to 40%

## 7. Implications for Training Game Design

### Who the Player Should Represent

The player in the training game should embody **Harper's broker/producer** -- someone who leverages AI tools to handle the operational grind while focusing on the high-value human skills:

1. **Understanding client risk** (asking the right questions)
2. **Building trust** (empathy, credibility, expertise)
3. **Making coverage recommendations** (advisory, not just transactional)
4. **Navigating complex placements** (E&S risks that others can't solve)

### Realistic Scenarios for the Game

Based on the workflow research, high-fidelity training scenarios include:

- **Discovery call with a new prospect** -- manufacturing company, aerospace startup, construction firm
- **Gathering risk information** -- knowing what to ask, handling incomplete data
- **Explaining coverage gaps** to a client who thinks they're fully covered
- **Presenting a proposal** with multiple carrier options at different price/coverage trade-offs
- **Handling the "uninsurable" client** -- Harper's 85% success rate on hard-to-place risks
- **Renewal conversation** where the market has hardened and premiums are increasing 20%+
- **Claims situation** where the client is upset and needs guidance
- **Objection handling** -- "why should I leave my current broker?"

### What Makes Harper's Broker Different

- Access to 10x more carriers through AI-powered matching
- Faster turnaround (days vs. weeks)
- Better data = better submissions = better quotes
- Can handle "impossible" risks that traditional brokers decline
- Lower overhead means competitive pricing
- The broker spends time on clients, not on forms
